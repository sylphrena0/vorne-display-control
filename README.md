# NMS Display Control Software for Vorne Industries M1000 Displays
*Author: Kirk Kleinsasser*

*Developed for North Mountain Supply, Inc*

This program uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) to host a web server that controls Vorne M1000 displays over serial. Includes friendly configuration menus, user managment, and a module to connect to the [Shipstation API](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025856212-ShipStation-API) to display order data. Uses a [SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) database to store userdata, logs, and settings. Allows users to set power timeout to conserve power at night.
